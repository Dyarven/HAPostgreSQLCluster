# HA PostgreSQL Cluster

Documentation on building a highly available, automated and scalable PostgreSQL cluster with load balancing, connection pooling, autofailover, backup repositories and a distributed configuration store. This is only a test lab and not the final product to deploy in a production environment. It is, however, very detailed and thoroughly tested. 

Currently available in Galician. I plan on translating it to English when I find the time for it. It contains a lot of screenshots to speed up the process and facilitate comprehension.
